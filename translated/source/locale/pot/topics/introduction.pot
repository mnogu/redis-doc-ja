msgid "Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced **key-value store**. It is often referred to as a **data structure server** since keys can contain `strings </topics/data-types#strings>`__, `hashes </topics/data-types#hashes>`__, `lists </topics/data-types#lists>`__, `sets </topics/data-types#sets>`__ and `sorted sets </topics/data-types#sorted-sets>`__."

msgid "You can run **atomic operations** on these types, like `appending to a string </commands/append>`__; `incrementing the value in a hash </commands/hincrby>`__; `pushing to a list </commands/lpush>`__; `computing set intersection </commands/sinter>`__, `union </commands/sunion>`__ and `difference </commands/sdiff>`__; or `getting the member with highest ranking in a sorted set </commands/zrangebyscore>`__."

msgid "In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an **in-memory dataset**. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either by `dumping the dataset to disk </topics/persistence#snapshotting>`__ every once in a while, or by `appending each command to a log </topics/persistence#append-only-file>`__."

msgid "Redis is written in **ANSI C** and works in most POSIX systems like Linux, \\*BSD, OS X without external dependencies. Linux and OSX are the two operating systems where Redis is developed and more tested, and we **recommend using Linux for deploying**. Redis may work in Solaris-derived systems like SmartOS, but the support is *best effort*. There is no official support for Windows builds, but Microsoft develops and maintains a `Win32-64 experimental version of Redis <https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis>`__."
