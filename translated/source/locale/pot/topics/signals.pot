msgid "The ``SIGTERM`` signals tells Redis to shutdown gracefully. When this signal is received the server does not actually exits as a result, but it schedules a shutdown very similar to the one performed when the ``SHUTDOWN`` command is called. The scheduled shutdown starts ASAP, specifically as long as the current command in execution terminates (if any), with a possible additional delay of 0.1 seconds or less."
