msgid "**WHY HAVE TRADEMARK GUIDELINES?** The Redis trademarks are a symbol of the quality and community support associated with the Redis open source software. Trademarks protect not only those using the marks, but the entire community as well. Our community members need to know that they can rely on the quality represented by the brand. We also want to provide a level playing field. No one should use the Redis marks in ways that mislead or take advantage of the community, or make unfair use of the trademarks. Also, use of our marks should not be in a disparaging manner because we prefer that our marks not be used to be rude about the Redis open source project or its members."

msgid "**OPEN SOURCE LICENSE VS. TRADEMARKS**. The three-clause BSD license gives you the right to redistribute and use the software in source and binary forms, with or without modification, under certain conditions. However, open source licenses like the three-clause BSD license do not address trademarks. Redis trademarks and brands need to be used in a way consistent with trademark law, and that is why we have prepared this policy – to help you understand what branding is allowed or required when using our software."

msgid "**PROPER USE OF THE Redis TRADEMARKS AND LOGO**. We want to encourage a robust community for the Redis open source project. Therefore, you may do any of the following, as long as you do so in a way that does not devalue, dilute, or disparage the Redis brand. In other words, when you do these things, you should behave responsibly and reasonably in the interest of the community, but you do not need a trademark license from us to do them."

msgid "a.i. If you develop applications for Redis, you may state that your application is designed to work with Redis, without using the Redis logo. For example, if you are developing a Foobar tool for Redis, acceptable project titles would be “Foobar for Redis\" or \"Redis-powered Foobar Tool\". We strongly discourage, and likely would consider it a trademark problem, to use a name such as “Redis Foobar.”"
