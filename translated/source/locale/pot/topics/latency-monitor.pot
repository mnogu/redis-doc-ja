msgid "Redis is often used in the context of demanding use cases, where it serves a big amount of queries per second per instance, and at the same time, there are very strict latency requirements both for the average response time and for the worst case latency."

msgid "While Redis is an in memory system, it deals with the operating system in different ways, for example, in the context of persisting to disk. Moreover Redis implements a rich set of commands. Certain commands are fast and run in constant or logarithmic time, other commands are slower O(N) commands, that can cause latency spikes."

msgid "Finally Redis is single threaded: this is usually an advantage from the point of view of the amount of work it can perform per core, and in the latency figures it is able to provide, but at the same time it poses a challenge from the point of view of latency, since the single thread must be able to perform certain tasks incrementally, like for example keys expiration, in a way that does not impact the other clients that are served."

msgid "Different monitored code paths have different names, and are called *events*. For example ``command`` is an event measuring latency spikes of possibly slow commands executions, while ``fast-command`` is the event name for the monitoring of the O(1) and O(log N) commands. Other events are less generic, and monitor a very specific operation performed by Redis. For example the ``fork`` event only monitors the time taken by Redis to execute the ``fork(2)`` system call."

msgid "So the first step to enable the latency monitor is to set a **latency threshold** in milliseconds. Only events that will take more than the specified threshold will be logged as latency spikes. The user should set the threshold according to its needs. For example if for the requirements of the application based on Redis the maximum acceptable latency is 100 milliseconds, the threshold should be set to such a value in order to log all the events blocking the server for a time equal or greater to 100 milliseconds."
