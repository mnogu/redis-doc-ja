msgid "``MULTI``, ``EXEC``, ``DISCARD`` and ``WATCH`` are the foundation of transactions in Redis. They allow the execution of a group of commands in a single step, with two important guarantees:"

msgid "Either all of the commands or none are processed, so a Redis transaction is also atomic. The ``EXEC`` command triggers the execution of all the commands in the transaction, so if a client loses the connection to the server in the context of a transaction before calling the ``MULTI`` command none of the operations are performed, instead if the ``EXEC`` command is called, all the operations are performed. When using the `append-only file </topics/persistence#append-only-file>`__ Redis makes sure to use a single write(2) syscall to write the transaction on disk. However if the Redis server crashes or is killed by the system administrator in some hard way it is possible that only a partial number of operations are registered. Redis will detect this condition at restart, and will exit with an error. Using the ``redis-check-aof`` tool it is possible to fix the append only file that will remove the partial transaction so that the server can start again."

msgid "An argument against Redis point of view is that bugs happen, however it should be noted that in general the roll back does not save you from programming errors. For instance if a query increments a key by 2 instead of 1, or increments the wrong key, there is no way for a rollback mechanism to help. Given that no one can save the programmer from his errors, and that the kind of errors required for a Redis command to fail are unlikely to enter in production, we selected the simpler and faster approach of not supporting roll backs on errors."
