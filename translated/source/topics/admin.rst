Redis Administration
====================

This page contains topics related to the administration of Redis
instances. Every topic is self contained in form of a FAQ. New topics
will be created in the future.

Redis setup hints
-----------------

-  We suggest deploying Redis using the **Linux operating system**.
   Redis is also tested heavily on osx, and tested from time to time on
   FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems. However Linux is where we do all the
   major stress testing, and where most production deployments are
   working.
-  Make sure to set the Linux kernel **overcommit memory setting to 1**.
   Add ``vm.overcommit_memory = 1`` to ``/etc/sysctl.conf`` and then
   reboot or run the command ``sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1`` for this
   to take effect immediately.
-  Make sure to **setup some swap** in your system (we suggest as much
   as swap as memory). If Linux does not have swap and your Redis
   instance accidentally consumes too much memory, either Redis will
   crash for out of memory or the Linux kernel OOM killer will kill the
   Redis process.
-  If you are using Redis in a very write-heavy application, while
   saving an RDB file on disk or rewriting the AOF log **Redis may use
   up to 2 times the memory normally used**. The additional memory used
   is proportional to the number of memory pages modified by writes
   during the saving process, so it is often proportional to the number
   of keys (or aggregate types items) touched during this time. Make
   sure to size your memory accordingly.
-  Even if you have persistence disabled, Redis will need to perform RDB
   saves if you use replication.
-  The use of Redis persistence with **EC2 EBS volumes is discouraged**
   since EBS performance is usually poor. Use ephemeral storage to
   persist and then move your persistence files to EBS when possible.
-  If you are deploying using a virtual machine that uses the **Xen
   hypervisor you may experience slow fork() times**. This may block
   Redis from a few milliseconds up to a few seconds depending on the
   dataset size. Check the `latency page </topics/latency>`__ for more
   information. This problem is not common to other hypervisors.
-  Use ``daemonize no`` when run under daemontools.

Upgrading or restarting a Redis instance without downtime
---------------------------------------------------------

Redis is designed to be a very long running process in your server. For
instance many configuration options can be modified without any kind of
restart using the `CONFIG SET command </commands/config-set>`__.

Starting from Redis 2.2 it is even possible to switch from AOF to RDB
snapshots persistence or the other way around without restarting Redis.
Check the output of the 'CONFIG GET \*' command for more information.

However from time to time a restart is mandatory, for instance in order
to upgrade the Redis process to a newer version, or when you need to
modify some configuration parameter that is currently not supported by
the CONFIG command.

The following steps provide a very commonly used way in order to avoid
any downtime.

-  Setup your new Redis instance as a slave for your current Redis
   instance. In order to do so you need a different server, or a server
   that has enough RAM to keep two instances of Redis running at the
   same time.
-  If you use a single server, make sure that the slave is started in a
   different port than the master instance, otherwise the slave will not
   be able to start at all.
-  Wait for the replication initial synchronization to complete (check
   the slave log file).
-  Make sure using INFO that there are the same number of keys in the
   master and in the slave. Check with redis-cli that the slave is
   working as you wish and is replying to your commands.
-  Configure all your clients in order to use the new instance (that is,
   the slave).
-  Once you are sure that the master is no longer receiving any query
   (you can check this with the `MONITOR
   command </commands/monitor>`__), elect the slave to master using the
   **SLAVEOF NO ONE** command, and shut down your master.
