Overview
--------

Redis Design Drafts are a way to make the community aware of designs
planned in order to modify or evolve Redis. Every new Redis Design Draft
is published in the Redis mailing list and announced on Twitter, in the
hope to receive feedbacks before implementing a given feature.

The way the community can provide feedbacks about a RDD is simply
writing a message to the Redis mailing list, or commenting in the
associated Github issue if any.

Drafts are published only for features already approved as potentially
very interesting for the project by the current Redis project
maintainer.

The official Redis web site includes a list of published RDDs.

Format
------

The format of RDDs should reflect the format of this RDD.
